        <h1>8/ 18/ 2024</h1>
        <p><b>12:40</b> || It is almost 1 am and I am currently on my laptop *dud* listening to jazz and reading chapter 18 of the enchanted kingdom fanfiction. Which is really good, the writing is exquisite. This piece of literature had kept me awake for so many night. Also honorable mention to a witch in broad daylight by epsilon-delta, which is another great fan fiction with alot of world building and twidash ship.<br>Today wasnt memorable in anyway, I didnt ask for the funds and so it will have to wait another day . At the same time, the fact that i didnt join the class group and not have the teacher phone number is still bothering me as it should. Im not up-to-date with my information and I dont know when is the next meet-up.<br>I guess that all for today. This probably wont be a daily thing since i rarely get any inspraration for wrting so dont expect anything. Goodnight (ÔΩûÔø£‚ñΩÔø£)ÔΩû </p>
        <p><b>1:02 am</b> || ‚ÄúSew, ladies!‚Äù Rarity yelled, jumping atop a table. ‚ÄúSew like your life depends on it!‚Äù . Oh my gosh, this is somehow funny. The writing convey such a rush feeling, the short sentences, the expressions, ... Everything just added up to a beautifal scene. I cant wait for the rest of this chapter and the next one.</p>
        <p><b>1:12</b> || I am now finishing the 18th chapter and TWILIGHT CAN GO INTO RARITY DREAMS NOW!! This introduced a whole new thing, what is she dreaming about? Why is she having nightmares? So many questions just popped up out of nowhere and I am excited to read the next chapter ^_____^</p>
        <p><b>11:23 am</b> || So uhh... It is scorching hot right now, the sun is beaming it's deadly laser and i have a choice to make. Either i go to the book shop , which is only about 2km away or 10 minutes of biking or i can wait for the star to move away then go.</p>
        <p><b>11:27 am</b> || Well since i still have alot on my todo list, i should go now to save some time then when i get home i can do whatever i need to do. The choice is made then!</p>
        <p><b>3:30 pm</b> || I just got back from the gym. To day was pull day, but i didnt do deadlift since i decided to have a seperate day for leg with 2 excercises. It was brutal, my bicep is pumped, back is hard as hell. But when i was walking to my room, i accidentally talked and some girl just happens to walk by üóø. No words can express how embarrassed i was and still am right now. Aight put that aside just start the 17th chapter of TEK and now rarity avoiding sleep bruh (o_ _)Ôæâ classic rarity move. <br>Also i didnt bought all the book needed just most of them i cant find 3 books so i guess i'll have to embark on a trip again tomorrow.<br>I took a look throught the new book and I must say it is not as hard as i had think. Sure, it's new but not hard. Most likely because these are just an introduction to prepare us but i dont think i will struggle much during these next few months.
        <p><b>9:15 pm</b> || Ughhh... I feel like im missing something. Most of the time i can occupied myself with code but if that the only thing i could do then it would be boring quick. School won't start till september so nothing about that. Reading need my full attention to imagine the story and youtube have nothing that interest me.
        <p><b>9:24 pm</b> || Applejack snorted. ‚ÄúAt this rate, I reckon‚Äô we should hire a therapist and we‚Äôll get y‚Äôall out of there lickety-split.‚Äù LOL exactly what i'm thinking!</p>

            <p><b>4:35 pm</b> || Hello, I've just completed the background music thing and it worked out perfectly thought it did feel a bit tedious having to copy and past 15 line of code(‚óèÀá‚àÄÀá‚óè). Tonight i'll have to go the english class so i wont have much time to do anything else. Additionally, I found a interest in mechanical engineering. It all began when youtube recommended me a video with a <i>16 years old</i> who built a electric car from sratch and after watching that video i feel kinda dumb.<br> Still i dont know if this feeling will last and is it somehting that i should look at but for the next few days watching video about electrical or mechanical theories is on my todo list now :D. <br> Though, i think for now my priorities will still be on python and web-making. Atleast until i finished this web-sites and the cs50 course. 
            <p><b>10:38 pm</b> || Ok, I've gotten back from the english class and bought some books but still not all of them... Also i've bought a my little pony sticker sheet on chinese o(*^Ôº†^*)o. Putting that amazing news aside, opening up the chemistry book i found some stuff that i have no clue about and im worrying that it might be bad that i have no idea what it mean. So i will spend some time learning some stuff to make sure i have a smooth start and doesnt trip at the starting line.</p>

            <p><b>11:26 am</b> || Man. Yesterday i tried to upload the background music to github but it to heavy so i couldnt. So i just remove the thing entirely since i spend 2 hours just to find a way to fix the thing. Also it's leg day today and lord please, let my leg heal faster i cant handle being disabled for 5 days everytime i do leg!</p>
            <p><b>11:32 pm</b> || 12 hours later... So i've spend the entire evening doing programming stuff. Python is pretty fun, i found a fresh video about those ball faling short from Dung lai lap trinh. It's easy to understand, I dont know if im not good enough in english or something but i feel like the vietnamese version is easier than that of the english version. I finish the first part of the thing, most of the time was spent to just understand the theories behind these code like the Law of cosine and dot product of a vector (_„ÄÄ_)„ÄÇ„ÇúzÔΩöÔº∫. It's a fun way to spend my time when i still have anytime at all.<br>Personnally, I'm kinda confident that when the school years start im going to have no time to do these stuff at all and that statement is from past expriences. So i might as well enjoy this while it last. </p>

            <p><b>2:50 pm</b> || Gooday mate! Today ive found the sherloc tv series on facebook which was so out of hand i want to watch it and so i did the first few episodes i had vivid memories of since i watched it a long time ago but havent touch any of the other seasons yet. In episode 1 of season 2 i really like this quote "Sentiment? Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side"<br>It just show how difference the holmes bother are to the rest of the character. To them emotions is just a disadvantages, clues given to your enemies.</p>

            <p><b>7:00 am</b> || Dear diary, Last night i think i had a nightmare about my teeth being crooked (Ôºø„ÄÄÔºø). I think it mostly because the lack of the sleep and the stress of waking up so soon since today i have to wake up at 5 am to go biking with a friend and if you didnt know i hate being late and dissapointing others. I had think about canceling the biking thing but that would be rude canceling at the last day but still my leg is still sore since last leg day.</p>

            <p><b>11:12 pm</b> || Hello „Éæ(‚Ä¢œâ‚Ä¢`)o. I know it has been quite long since i last wrote anything in here but as i said before this isnt suppose to be a daily thing. Today i was "forced" to get involve in a sleepover which i dont mind that much to be honest. The day school start is getting closer by the day and I think im ready for it. I had a quick look through the math and technology book and it not that hard. But the boredom is still present in my daily life since i have nothing to do in my <i>free</i> time. <br>Oh shit i just remember i didnt finish my gym routine today üèãÔ∏è i only did like 4 sets of bench which is barely enough. Welp that's that now, is it what it is. </i></p>

            <h1>9/ 3/ 2024</h1>
            <p><b>8:20 pm</b> || I feel like it's impossible. Like i can hold my self together by with my own hand but asking for help is just so hard, especially parents. The way I think of this is that im scared and i repeate <i>scared</i> that I would get into some sort of lecture. Maybe i didnt swipe the kitchen clean enough or I didnt do exactlly as told ‚ï∞Ôºà‚Äµ‚ñ°‚Ä≤Ôºâ‚ïØ. So i would often just try to avoid any interaction with him. Yes, I realize how obsurd that sound but im trying my best to work with what i have right now. As for how i would adress this problem... I absolutely have no idea, i havent even thought of facing it directly due to our different look on stuff.<br>Now it doesnt mean that i dont believe in what he have accomplished over the years, he is a great person and everyone have flaws and mistake that they made through out their life. But the way he talk for some reasons just irritate me.</p>
            <p><b>8:30 pm</b> || Putting that sentimental thing aside (even though i shouldnt (‚ïπ⁄°‚ïπ )), tomorrow i'll have to go to school to prepare for the school year to start, aka manual labour without pay ‚ÜÇ. Also yesterday i found a my little pony fan comic call Space Ponyos (<a href="https://spaceponyos.com">https://spaceponyos.com</a>) for reason unknown i found it really interesting. But as everything that im fond of it either ending, take a long time to release or ended. In this case the comic only released 2 issues then goes silenced for the last 2 years üò≠ this shit happen everytime. Also i've heard stuff about the creator, really, really, really <b><i>BAD</i></b> stuffs. Shadman level stuff. So my speculation is that there was some backlash and he just decided to cancelled the whole project as a whole. Holy shit i just came up with the coolest idea ever ‚òÜ‚åí(*Ôºæ-„Çú)v!! What if, and hear me out. What if i start every entry on this thing with a horrible(?optionnal) pun. Yes that would require more time but think about how funny it will be when i read this thing all those years in the future lol.</p>
            <p><b>8:50 pm</b> || Okay let start here. Okok after like 10 minutes of straight research i have this. What do you call a half-human half=horse being who constantly being watch by everyone around them? The centaur of attention ü™Ñüêé. I've started this new <a href="https://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/2/background-pony/ii-lunatics-dream">_fic_</a> from the first look it feel kinda depressing, lyra is stuck in a time-loop but not really a time loop. It more like a curse where every evident or your existent just get erase, just like the x-men Forget-me-not. I only read the first chapter and getting started on the next chapter but i really enjoyed the writing style and how they just use 18+ words so casually lol. Some of the one that i remember are fuck, gay panic, queerness,... I think some of it are originated from the other fanfic but who the hell care it funny so i'll put it there</p>

Yesterday i settled that i want to learn how to DRAW A PONY, and it turn out quite unexpectedly. I just realized how rusty my art skill are right now, the drawing are horrible üò≠, but still im improving tho. Now im questioning my artistic skill, somehow i used to be the art guy in class bruh ü§£. Onto the next point, tomorrow will be the first offical school day and i will have to actually LEARN at SCHOOL /(„Ñío„Ñí)/~~. Goodluck cause ima need it.</p>

            <p><b>7:50 pm</b> || Hello again ^_~. Now i know it've been a long time since i last updated this page but everything has it's reason. I was trying to keep up with the new curriculum. The worries wont go down unless everything was good i need to prepare more so i didnt have much time especially when i have to drop my sister off at school every morning taking like 1 hour off my sleep. But in my opinion all will be good the only thing that make me nervous is literature as always üò≠ but im working on that to. I'll asume that this is it for this update stay tune for more üåà.</p>

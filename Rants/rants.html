        <p><b>12:40</b> || It is almost 1 am and I am currently on my laptop *dud* listening to jazz and reading chapter 18 of the enchanted kingdom fanfiction. Which is really good, the writing is exquisite. This piece of literature had kept me awake for so many night. Also honorable mention to a witch in broad daylight by epsilon-delta, which is another great fan fiction with alot of world building and twidash ship.<br>Today wasnt memorable in anyway, I didnt ask for the funds and so it will have to wait another day . At the same time, the fact that i didnt join the class group and not have the teacher phone number is still bothering me as it should. Im not up-to-date with my information and I dont know when is the next meet-up.<br>I guess that all for today. This probably wont be a daily thing since i rarely get any inspraration for wrting so dont expect anything. Goodnight (ÔΩûÔø£‚ñΩÔø£)ÔΩû </p>
        <p><b>1:02 am</b> || ‚ÄúSew, ladies!‚Äù Rarity yelled, jumping atop a table. ‚ÄúSew like your life depends on it!‚Äù . Oh my gosh, this is somehow funny. The writing convey such a rush feeling, the short sentences, the expressions, ... Everything just added up to a beautifal scene. I cant wait for the rest of this chapter and the next one.</p>
        <p><b>1:12</b> || I am now finishing the 18th chapter and TWILIGHT CAN GO INTO RARITY DREAMS NOW!! This introduced a whole new thing, what is she dreaming about? Why is she having nightmares? So many questions just popped up out of nowhere and I am excited to read the next chapter ^_____^</p>

        <p><b>11:23 am</b> || So uhh... It is scorching hot right now, the sun is beaming it's deadly laser and i have a choice to make. Either i go to the book shop , which is only about 2km away or 10 minutes of biking or i can wait for the star to move away then go.</p>
        <p><b>11:27 am</b> || Well since i still have alot on my todo list, i should go now to save some time then when i get home i can do whatever i need to do. The choice is made then!</p>
        <p><b>3:30 pm</b> || I just got back from the gym. To day was pull day, but i didnt do deadlift since i decided to have a seperate day for leg with 2 excercises. It was brutal, my bicep is pumped, back is hard as hell. But when i was walking to my room, i accidentally talked and some girl just happens to walk by üóø. No words can express how embarrassed i was and still am right now. Aight put that aside just start the 17th chapter of TEK and now rarity avoiding sleep bruh (o_ _)Ôæâ classic rarity move. <br>Also i didnt bought all the book needed just most of them i cant find 3 books so i guess i'll have to embark on a trip again tomorrow.<br>I took a look throught the new book and I must say it is not as hard as i had think. Sure, it's new but not hard. Most likely because these are just an introduction to prepare us but i dont think i will struggle much during these next few months.
